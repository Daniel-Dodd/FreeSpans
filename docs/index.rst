Welcome to FreeSpans!
=================================

FreeSpans is libray to model submarine pipeline spans built on GPJax that supports GPU acceleration and just-in-time compilation. 

The seabed is an active environment, with changing mechanical characteristics and fluctuating bathymetry, driven by the ocean above and the action of infrastructure resting on it. As such, submarine pipelines can become destabilised by spans, where parts of the pipe are no longer fully supported by the seafloor. Depending on the length of the span and the exposure to damaging water movements, pipelines can suffer strength degradation that results in leakage if not addressed in time. Consequently, integrity management through inspections and remediations is vital in preventing catastrophic environmental impacts.

Inspections of subsea structures are critical for avoiding severe financial and environmental consequences, yet their expense often renders it infeasible to survey all sites regularly. FreeSpans is a library of tools to model and simulate the effects of span damage on submarine pipelines.
